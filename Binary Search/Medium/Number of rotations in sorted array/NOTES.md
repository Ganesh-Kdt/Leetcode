Intuition - 

1.To find how many times a sorted array is rotated we can check how many times the smallest number at index 0 in sorted array is rotated.

2.If the smallest number in sorted array is rotated twice then the element will be at index 2 in rotated array. And it's index will be the number of times the array is rotated.

3.eg.-[1,2,3,4,5] - sorted array

4.eg.-[5,1,2,3,4] - rotated array

5.Since 1 is moved from index 0 to index 1 therefore the array is rotated by 1.
