1.eg.-[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] if the length of the array is 7 and we have to move the array to right by 3 positions i.e k=3.
2.Then we will first create a new array and keep the last 3 elements into this array.
3.Then we will move the remaining elements by 3 positions to the right.
4.Finally we will insert the 3 elements to the start of the array.
