1.We will keep adding both nodes data to a sum variable and then create a new Node using the sum variable.
2.If the sum becomes greater than 9, then we will keep the units digit of the sum in the new Node.
3.If the sum becomes smaller than or equal to 9, we will keep the units digit of the sum in the new Node.
4.We will also keep connecting these nodes.
