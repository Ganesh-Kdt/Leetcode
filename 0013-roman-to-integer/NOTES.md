1.The inuition behind it is to check if the current character is greater than or equal to the next character.
2.We will create a hashmap to map the character to the corresponding integer value.
3.If the ablove condition is true then add the corresponding value of the character to the sum variable.
4.If the condition is false and the current character is smaller than the next character then subtract the corresponding value of the character to the sum variable.
