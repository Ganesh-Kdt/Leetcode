This is a special case of cyclic linked list.
1.We can solve this problem using hashmap by storing the refernce of the node.
2.Or we can solve it using fast and slow pointers.
3.The fast and slow pointers will always collide will there is a cycle.
4.And if they collide then we have a cyclic linked list.
