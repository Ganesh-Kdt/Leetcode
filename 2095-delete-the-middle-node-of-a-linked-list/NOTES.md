1.Solve this problem using fast and slow pointer.
2.To eliminate the mid element we can find the element previous to the mid and link to the element after the mid.
3.So using fast and slow pointers we found the mid, which will be pointed by slow pointer.
4.Used a prevSlow pointer which will be one step behind the slow pointer, this will help us to use the prevSlow pointer to point to the element after the mid value.
